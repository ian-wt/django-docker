## About

A simple project start for a Django monolith in Docker with PostgreSQL.

## Setup

To get up and running, follow these steps:

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root and add the following:

```text
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=not-a-secure-secret-key
DJANGO_DEBUG=true
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0
DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1,http://0.0.0.0

POSTGRES_REQUIRE_SSL=false
POSTGRES_DB=devdb
POSTGRES_USER=devuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=not-a-secure-password
POSTGRES_MIGRATOR=devmigrator
POSTGRES_MIGRATOR_PASS=not-a-secure-password
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql

```

These values will allow you to begin working with Django in development.

**Important!** Do NOT use in production.

Use Django's get_random_secret_key() function to generate a secure key.

```python
# from a python shell

from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
```

See [Django Deployment Checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/deployment/checklist/#) 
for more information.

Also, the environment variable names are important if you decide to use
the postgres image in compose. For example, you need to use:
```text
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```
Otherwise the image won't pick up your environment variables and your
app service won't work with your db service.

See [Docker Postgres Docs](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) for more 
information on env vars.

### Configure WSGI -OR- ASGI

By default, this project is set up to deploy as a wsgi application. In
development, the native Django server is used so you get hot reloads and
you don't have to restart the server to reflect code changes. In production
the application will run on gunicorn. This is conditionally managed with
the arg 'DEV=true' in compose.yaml which will override the 'DEV=false' in
the Dockerfile. The 'DEV' arg is read in entrypoint.sh and the corresponding
server is started.

If you want to build an asgi application, you need to update:

* requirements.txt -> comment out (or remove) gunicorn from requirements.txt
  and uncomment daphne (assuming you want to use daphne as your asgi server)
* entrypoint.sh -> uncomment the command to start the daphne server and
  comment out (or remove) the command to start the gunicorn server.
* settings.py && asgi.py -> these files will need additional config; consult Django docs.

### Database

The project is set up to use postgresql by default, even in development. When the
database is first run, scripts/init-db.sh will configure the db consistent
with the credentials provided in the .env file.

The data is stored on a persistent volume so your dev data will be preserved
after you stop your service.

While compose will call scripts/migrate.sh so you don't need to migrate manually,
you do still need create your migrations manually with:
```bash
docker compose run app python manage.py makemigrations
```

(assuming your service is named 'app')

Last, the compose call stack also runs a scripts/fixtures.sh (empty by default)
where you can drop in fixtures you've registered in your settings.py file. This is
convenient for a users.json (or similar) so if you remove your volume, you don't
have to start over filling out a user in shell.

### Other Configurations

Both the host port and the container port are configured to run 8000. A 
default port for the container is provided in entrypoint.sh and there's nothing
passed as an environment variable by default since if you're running one server
per container, the container port doesn't really matter.

I left a commented section for an environment variable so if you do want to change
it, you're making changes in one place:
```yaml
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
#    environment:
#      - PORT=8000
```

If you want to run a multi-service / multi-server approach, update the left side
of the 'ports' mapping to a unique value between services. Ex., start the gunicorn
on 8000 & start daphne on 8001.
